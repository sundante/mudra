## Vision

**"The richness of a premium fintech dashboard — but warmer, gold-first, and more personal."**

Reference: an 8-screen blue/purple fintech UI (shared 2026-05-27). We want the same density of information and chart variety, recoloured in the Mudra gold palette — warm white base, gold heroes, semantic green/red/amber data, no blue gradients.

Key differentiators vs the reference:
- **Gold hero gradient** instead of blue/purple — feels premium Indian finance, not generic
- **Cormorant Garamond** for large numbers — authoritative and elegant, not just bold sans
- **Warm semantic grammar** — green = good, red = bad, amber = investment — universally readable

## Reference Screen Patterns (to adopt)

### Screen 1 — Earning Insights
- Bar histogram of variable spend/income over time (monthly, animated on load)
- "Earning this month" display number in Cormorant
- Month-over-month comparison chip
- **Status**: not yet built — Chart Type 3 (bar chart)

### Screen 2 — Account + Net Worth Overview
- Credit card visual (gradient card with card number style)
- Net Worth below with assets/liabilities breakdown
- Timeline filter chips (1M / 3M / 6M / All)
- **Status**: partially built — net worth hero exists; card visual pending

### Screen 3 — Reports / Transfers
- Monthly grouped bar chart (income vs expense side-by-side, two colours)
- "View Transaction" CTA below chart
- Monthly budget progress bar
- **Status**: not built

### Screen 4 — Breakdown & Budget (left)
- Category donut (full ring) with % labels on segments
- Income / Expenses / Budget tab filter
- Per-category progress rows with colour-coded % bars
- **Status**: donut partially built; progress rows not built

### Screen 5 — Spending Insights
- "Spending this month" Cormorant hero number (red)
- Sparkline area chart — 4-week spend trend with area fill
- Recurring Transactions list (icon · name · amount · frequency chip)
- **Status**: not built — needs Chart Type 6 (sparkline) + new screen

### Screen 6 — Breakdown & Budget (right)
- Stacked category bar (horizontal, multi-segment)
- Category chips as filter above bars
- **Status**: not built — Chart Type 5 (stacked bar)

### Screen 7 — Income Source Breakdown
- Salary / Freelance / Rental income rows
- Horizontal progress bars per source scaled to %
- Donut on right showing allocation
- **Status**: not built — Chart Type 4 (income flow tree)

### Screen 8 — Quick Actions
- 2×3 grid of action tiles (icon + label + optional sublabel)
- Current Home quick actions are a compact shortcut grid for financial work:
  Spending, Funds, Debts, Invests, Net Worth
- App Map is intentionally not in Quick Actions; it lives only in Profile
- "Ask Suguna" AI assistant entry point
- **Status**: partially built — shortcut grid exists; assistant entry pending
